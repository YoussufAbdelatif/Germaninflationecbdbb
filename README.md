forward-looking monetary policy reaction function

This paper estimates the forward-looking monetary policy reaction function proposed by Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2000) for Germany, before and after the Deutsche Bundesbank forwarded its duties to the European Central Bank in Q1/1999. Therefore, the GMM estimation is based on two subsamples: 1) Q1:1970-Q4:1998 and 2) Q1:1999-Q4:2019. 
The empirical analysis shows that the Deutsche Bundesbank reacted more sensitively to changes in expected inflation than the European Central Bank.
